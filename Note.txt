Transient State:
When an object of the Student class is created but not yet saved in the database.
The ID of this object is null in this state.
The object exists only in Java memory.
When save() is called:
First, it checks whether the object is new or has been saved before.
Criteria for detection: Is ID == null?
If yes → the object is new → uses EntityManager.persist().
If no → the object exists → uses EntityManager.merge().
What happens after persist()?
An INSERT is performed in the database.
The object changes state from transient to persistent.
An ID is created by the database for the object (e.g. 1).
Detached State:
After the transaction is committed and the EntityManager is closed, the object is no longer managed.
The object enters the detached state.
Always work only with the returned object after using save(). Depending on the circumstances, it may have been merged and a new object may have been returned.
